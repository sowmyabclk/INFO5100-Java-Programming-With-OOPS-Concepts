Final:

final is a keyword. we can use it for varible, methods and classes.

The values of variables which are declared with final scope can not be changed after they are initailized.
if the method is declared with final, it can not be overrideen in the child classes.
the classes with final keyword can not be inherited by other classes.

Example:

1)	public static void main(String[] args){

	final int value = 100;
	value = 20; // compile time error

	}

2)	public class Child extends Parent {
 
   	 @Override
    	void calc(int a, int b) {
        
    	}
     
    	@Override
    	final void totalCost() {
        // Compilation error
   	 }
 
	}

3)	public final class parent{

	}

	public class child extends parent{

	//compilation error
	}


finally:

finally is a block used in exception handling. This will be executed always whether there is an exception or not.

package Assignment5;

public class Division {
	
	public static int divide(int a ,int b) {
		int value = 0;
		try {
		 value = a/b;
		}
		catch(ArithmeticException e) {
			System.out.println("can not be divided by zero");
		}
		
		
		finally {
			Runtime.getRuntime().gc();   // used to free the memory evnen though the prgram halts due to an exception
			System.out.println("finally");
		
			
		}
		
		return value;

	}
