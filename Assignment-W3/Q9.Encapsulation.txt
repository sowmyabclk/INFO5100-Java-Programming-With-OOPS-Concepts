Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).

Encapsulation is a way of protecting the data from directly accessing and modifying it. Essentially this is known as data hiding. 
This is a technique where in we will make all the data in a class as private and will define setters and getters for the data.getters are used to read the data and setters are used to modify the data.
we can write validations in the setter so that if an object tries to change the data , it will be changed only if it meets those validations.


package AED.Assignment3;

public class encaps {
	
	private String studentName;
    private int studentId;
    private int studentAge;
	public String getStudentName() {
		return studentName;
	}
	public void setStudentName(String studentName) throws Exception {
		if(studentName.length() <=3)
			throw new Exception("student name must be greater than 3");
		this.studentName = studentName;
	}
	public int getStudentId() {
		return studentId;
	}
	public void setStudentId(int studentId) {
		this.studentId = studentId;
	}
	public int getStudentAge() {
		return studentAge;
	}
	public void setStudentAge(int studentAge) {
		this.studentAge = studentAge;
	}
	
	
}

main class-

package AED.Assignment3;

public class driverclass {
	public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception  
    { 
		encaps e1 = new encaps(); 
          
	//	System.out.println("student name "+e1.studentName); //can not get the data since it is private
        
		e1.setStudentName("Sowmya"); 
		e1.setStudentId(1); 
		e1.setStudentAge(20); 
		e1.setStudentName("abc"); //will get an error saying the student name must be greater than 3 since there is a validation in setter method
          
        
        System.out.println("student name: " + e1.getStudentName()); 
        System.out.println("student  age: " +e1.getStudentAge()); 
        System.out.println("student roll number: " +e1.getStudentId()); 
     //   e1.studentName = "sowmya"; // can not set the data as it is private
          
                
    } 

}
