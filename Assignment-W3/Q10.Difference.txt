
Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction

Abstraction

1.it hides the unnecessary data by giving it to users.
2.Abstraction really not focuses on the implementation of the function rather it focuses on what the function does.


Example : Marker.

void Marker(){
fillInk();
writeOnBoard();

}

We are not worried about how the implementation has been done on filling the ink andthe technique used to write on the board.


Encapsulation:

1.is a data-hiding technique or protecting the data from outside world. 
2.to access the data we will use getters and setters so encapsulation cares about implementation.

example


package AED.Assignment3;

public class encaps {
	
	private String studentName;
    
	public String getStudentName() {
		return studentName;
	}
	public void setStudentName(String studentName) throws Exception {
		if(studentName.length() <=3)
			throw new Exception("student name must be greater than 3");
		this.studentName = studentName;
	}
	
	
	
	
}

main class-

package AED.Assignment3;

public class driverclass {
	public static void main (String[] args) throws Exception  
    { 
		encaps e1 = new encaps(); 
          
	//	System.out.println("student name "+e1.studentName); //can not get the data since it is private
        
		
          
                
    } 

}
